		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>James Naismith was the Canadian physical education instructor who invented basketball in 1891. James Naismith was born in Almonte, Ontario and educated at McGill University and Presbyterian College in Montreal. He was the physical education teacher at McGill University from 1887 to 1890 and at Springfield College in Springfield, Massachusetts from 1890 to 1895. At Springfield College, James Naismith invented the indoor sport of basketball.</p>
		<h2>How to Play</h2>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/bask1.png" alt="Basics" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc">Two teams take to the court at the start of the game. Each team has five players, though you may play with as many or few as you want, so long as the teams are even. The players are trying to put the ball in a "basket", which is 10 feet above the ground. Each side has a hoop, and both teams are trying to get the ball in the opposite hoop while preventing their own from being scored in.</div>

			<div class="desc">The court is simple, once you get to know it. The midcourt line defines which half of the court the play is currently happening. If the offense starts the ball behind the midcourt line, they have ten seconds to get the ball back to the proper half. If they don't, the defense gets the ball. Once the ball is in it's proper half, it cannot be brought back. There is also a three point line, which making a basket outside the circle earns your team three points. Scoring, via a shot or a dunk, will earn you 2 points if you are inside the circle.</div>

			<img src="images/bask3.png" alt="Dribble" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc">The offense is the team with the ball, and the defense is the team without the ball. Simple, like most other sports out there. The person with the ball must "dribble", or bounce against the ground, while he is moving with the ball. If he stops dribbling, he has five seconds to either pass the ball or take a shot. They aren't allowed to "double dribble", start dribbling after he already stopped, or "travel", move with the ball without dribbling.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/bask4.png" alt="Denied!" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc">The defense can do many things to attempt to get the ball from the offense. They may take the ball while it's being dribbled, so long as such "stealing" isn't intentionally violent. They may "guard" a player standing with the ball, forcing him to get rid of it within 5 seconds. While defenders cannot interfere with a ball midair, they can pick up the rebound off of a failed shot/pass. Note that the moment the defenders obtain possession, they become the offense and must get to their half of the court.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/bask5.png" alt="Scoreboard" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc">The game is divided into 4 periods, each lasting anywhere from 6 to 10 minutes, depending on regulation. Typically, as long as the ball remains inbound and a foul isn't called, the clock will be ticking. Fouls are given when any of the rules above are broken, as well as many more. One thing to keep in mind is avoiding "Technical fouls", which means just having good manners. It's a game, after all, and using bad language and stuff like that just isn't fun.</div>
