		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>1845 was the beginning of systematic game with Alexander Cartwright's published book on set of baseball rules for the Knickerbocker Club of New York. It is claimed that his baseball rules were widely accepted in the US. In 1869 the first professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings were explicitly remunerated for the first time. In 1871, the National Association of Professional Baseball Players was established as the first professional baseball league. In 1876, over 3,000 enthusiasts watched the hometown Philadelphia Athletics lose to Boston Red in the first National League game ever played. In 1878, the Captain of Harvard University Baseball Club Frederick Thayer received a patent for baseball catcher mask. Many professional and amateur players contribute to the vast baseball history. Every chapter in baseball history leads to interesting event that helped with development of modern-day systematic baseball. By any name, baseball has been a game that sets stars in the eyes of sport lovers since decades.</p>
		<h2>How to Play</h2>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/base1.png" alt="Basics" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc">There are two teams in baseball, the batting team, and the pitching team. The batting team is trying to run around the field, going to each of the bases, before returning home. The pitching team is trying to stop them by getting three "outs" on the batting team. When the batting team gets three outs, the teams switch places, and the pitching team gets a chance to bat.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/base2.png" alt="Batter" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc">The batting team sends out one batter at a time. If the batter swings and misses the ball, he gets a strike. If he gets three strikes, he's out, and another player takes his place. Once a ball is hit, you should run as fast as you can to your next base! You're "safe" when you're on a base that doesn't have another teammate running to. While you're running to your next base, you could get "out" if the ball touches you or your next base before you're "safe".</div>
		</div>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/base3.png" alt="Pitcher" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc">The pitching team throws the ball at the batter, hoping to strike them out. Once the batter hits the ball, the pitcher's team may throw the ball between players in hopes of stopping the batting team's runners. You can get them "out" by touching them with the ball, or by touching a base that someone's running to before they get on it. You can also get the batter out by catching the ball before it hits the ground, making the other team unable to move to their next base.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/base4.png" alt="Home Run" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc">A special thing can happen in baseball, called a "home run". When you hit the ball, and the ball goes so far that it doesn't even land in the field, it is called a home run. It is impossible for the pitcher's team to get the ball back, so the batter's team can cross all the bases with no rush. Anyone still on bases at the time of the home run may return home, as well as the batter. If all the bases are loaded when the home run is struck, it is called a "Grand Slam", and, as math would tell you, the batter's team scores 4 points.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/base5.png" alt="Scoreboard" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc"> A baseball game is made up of nine "innings". A new inning starts when each team gets three outs, unlike other sports which go based off of time. Some people may refer to innings in different halves, as in, the "top" of an inning is when the first batting team is batting, and the "bottom" of an inning is when the first batting team is pitching. Note, the 10 shown in the scoreboard on the left is to denote a possible "overtime".</div>
