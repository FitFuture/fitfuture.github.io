		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>Consistent rules did not exist until the 1800s, when english public schools began to regulate the rules. One public school, Rugby School, chose not to follow the other rules. The schools that weren’t Rugby became known as “association football”, or soccer. Rugby traditions for some reason were mostly lost, aside from the addition of a goalpost, known now as the field goal, but could only make points from a place kick or a dropkick. This made points easier from a distance and also avoided the mass of defenders by the goal line.<br><br>For a while it still resembled rugby, until constant rule changes made it a unique game in itself. It wasn’t until representatives from various universities met in New York to formulate the first intercollegiate football rules. The four universities of Columbia, Rutgers, Princeton, and Yale, formed the foundation of the Intercollegiate Football Association (IFA). Yale soon broke from the rules to form smaller teams and a standard field size, as well as a system of downs. </p>
		<h2>How to Play</h2>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/foot1.png" alt="Basics" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc">Teams in the NFL are made of 11 players on either side. The offense is trying to get a player with the ball as far as possible down the field, while the defense tries to prevent the offense from gaining ground. From first down, you have up to four downs to get the ball at least ten yards, then you'll go back to first down.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/foot2.png" alt="Plays" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc">Plays start when the center gives the ball to the quarterback. The quarterback may then do a number of things. He may pass the ball, hand the ball off to a runner, or run with the ball himself. The defense may "cover", or stay near, offensive players trying to catch a pass to either block or intercept the pass, or try to put pressure on the offense to rush the quarterback or stop a runner.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/foot3.png" alt="Scoring" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc">If you can make it all the way to the defenses in-zone, you score a touchdown! Touchdowns are worth 6 points, and in most sports you have the chance to kick a field goal from the 2-yard line, which will be worth 1 point, or to do a single play starting at the 2-yard line to score another touch down, but will be worth 2 points. If you're playing and you don't have a field goal post, you may have to make up your own rules to best fit your situation.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/foot4.png" alt="Fourth Down" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc">However, if the defense prevents you from reaching the in-zone, and you are on your last down, you have several options. The safest option is usually a punt the ball, or to drop it, then kick it in mid-fall across the field, for the defense to recieve it. You may also attempt a field goal for 3 points if you think you're close enough to make it. Another, riskier option, is to make a play to try to either score or get a first down. Be warned, though, if you get stopped again, the other team will take the ball where you left it.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/foot5.png" alt="Scoreboard" width="150px" height="150px">
			<div class="desc">A game of football is 60 minutes long, divided up into four quarters of 15 minutes each, and also into two halves with two quarters each. At the start of each half, as well as after a score, there is a kickoff. Like the punt, you are kicking the ball as far down the field as you can to let the opposing team start their drive. You may also use time-outs to stop the game clock before your next play; but, you only get three per half, so use them wisely. You can also stop the ball by making a pass incomplete or by having a player with the ball run out of bounds.</div>
